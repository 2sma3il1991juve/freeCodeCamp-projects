    <h3 class="text-primary">- Who is George Carlin in lines?</h3>
    <p>George Denis Patrick Carlin(May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American comedian, actor, author and social critic.
        Carlin was noted for his black comedy and thoughts on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various
        taboo subjects. Carlin and his "seven dirty words" comedy routine were central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case
        F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a 5–4 decision affirmed the government's power to regulate indecent material
        on the public airwaves. He is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comedians: One
        newspaper called Carlin "the dean of counterculture comedians. In 2004, Carlin was placed second on the Comedy Central
        list of "Top 10 Comedians of US Audiences" compiled for an April 2004 special. The first of his 14 stand-up comedy
        specials for HBO was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlin's routines focused on sociocultural criticism of
        American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses
        of American culture. He was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny
        Carson era, and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live in 1975. His final HBO special, It's Bad for Ya,
        was filmed less than four months before his death. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Mark Twain Prize for
        American Humor. In 2017, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him second (behind Richard Pryor) on its list of the 50 best
        stand-up comics of all time.
